This repository hosts a robust Flask server designed to manage and process sentiment analysis requests efficiently. The core functionalities include endpoints to fetch analyzed sentiment data, submit fresh data for analysis, and gather aggregated sentiment statistics, all carefully developed with concurrency and security in mind. The server ensures that the API can handle multiple requests simultaneously without a hitch, thanks to its well-architected asynchronous handling and data processing capabilities. This project is ideal for those looking to integrate sentiment analysis into their applications, providing a solid backend solution to collect, analyze, and interpret sentiment data effectively.
